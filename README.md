# MusicPlayerJs
Music Player Js is a music player created using ReactJs, Redux, Styled-components and MERN stack to retrieved the music data
while the actual audio file was planned to integrate with spotify api.

It was inspired by https://github.com/tvillarete/apple-music-js repo except that i was rewritten it to further improve my understanding
while trying my best to use functional components and reacthooks. So far its a success.

It still is a work in progress.

TODO::
1. album view is not developed yet.
2. album list from artist view is still WIP
